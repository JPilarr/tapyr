# Name
#    Assertion
#
# Purpose
#    Provide Assert function nicer than Python's assert statement
#
# Revision Dates
#     8-Jul-2002 (CT) Creation (factored from U_Test.py)
#    24-Mar-2005 (CT) Use `TFL.Caller.globals` instead of `caller_globals`
#                     (and ditto for `locals`)
#    ««revision-date»»···
