  Welcome to the Sphinx quickstart utility.

  Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
  accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

  Enter the root path for documentation.
  > Root path for the documentation [.]:

  You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
  Either, you use a directory ".build" within the root path, or you separate
  "source" and "build" directories within the root path.
  > Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: y

  Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; ".templates"
  for custom HTML templates and ".static" for custom stylesheets and other
  static files. Since the leading dot may be inconvenient for Windows users,
  you can enter another prefix (such as "_") to replace the dot.
  > Name prefix for templates and static dir [.]:

  The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
  > Project name: Tanzers Python Packages
  > Author name(s): Christian Tanzer

  Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
  software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
  Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
  something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
  just set both to the same value.
  > Project version: 1.x
  > Project release [1.x]:

  The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
  or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
  > Source file suffix [.rst]:

  One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
  "contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
  of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
  document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
  > Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]:

  Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
  > autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: y
  > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: y
  > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: y

  If you are under Unix, a Makefile can be generated for you so that you
  only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
  directly.
  > Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]:

  Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

  You should now populate your master file ./source/index.rst and create other
  documentation source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
     make builder
  where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or
  linkcheck.
